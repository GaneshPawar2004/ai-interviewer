Q1: Explain the difference between primitive data types and reference data types in Java, providing examples of each and illustrating how they behave in memory.
Your Answer: Primitive data types (like `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`) store the actual value directly in memory on the stack.  For example, `int age = 25;` places the value 25 directly in the memory location assigned to `age`. Reference data types (like `String`, custom objects, arrays) store a *reference* (a memory address) to the object's data, which resides on the heap. For example, `String name = \"Alice\";` stores the memory address where the characters 'A', 'l', 'i', 'c', 'e' are stored on the heap.  Primitives are efficient for simple values, while references are used for complex objects, enabling dynamic memory management and object-oriented features.
Q2: Describe a scenario where you would choose to use an ArrayList over a standard Java array, and vice-versa.  Explain the trade-offs involved in your decision.
Your Answer: Use an `ArrayList` when you need a dynamic collection that can grow or shrink at runtime.  For example, when you're reading data from a file and don't know how many items there will be.  Use an array when you know the size beforehand and performance is critical.  For example, processing a fixed set of data in a game.  `ArrayList` trade-offs: more memory overhead due to dynamic resizing, potential performance impact from auto-boxing/unboxing. Array trade-offs: fixed size (can't easily add/remove elements), requires manual resizing if needed.  Choose `ArrayList` for flexibility, arrays for raw speed when size is known.
Q3: Explain the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming. Provide a Java code example demonstrating polymorphism and discuss its benefits in software design.
Your Answer: i dont know
